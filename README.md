# Phase 4, Lecture 2: Rest APIs with Flask (Part 1)

## Lecture Topics

- Handling POST requests
- Rest APIs with Flask (GET and POST requests)

## Important Definitions

- Representational State Transfer (REST): a convention for developing applications that use HTTP in a consistent, human-readable, machine-readable way.
- Application Programming Interface (API): a software application that allows two or more software applications to communicate with one another.
- GET: the most common HTTP request method. Signifies that the client is attempting to view the located resource.
- POST: the second most common HTTP request method. Signifies that the client is attempting to submit a form to create a new resource.

## Introduction

In today's lecture, we will add functionality to our Flask app to handle POST requests. We will also discuss about REST APIs with Flask.

## Setup

1. Fork and then Clone this repository.

2. Make sure that you are in the correct directory (folder) that contains a `Pipfile`, then run `pipenv install` in your terminal to install the required libraries.

3. Now that your `pipenv` virtual environment is ready to use, enter `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment.

4. Enter the command `cd server` in the terminal to move into the server directory.

5. Run these commands in the terminal (make sure that you are in the `server` directory before running these terminal commands):

```py
export FLASK_APP=app.py

export FLASK_RUN_PORT=7000
```

6. We will write code in the `app.py` file to build functionality to handle POST requests to the `/hotels` route.

7. Enter the command `flask run` or `python app.py` in the terminal to run the Flask app (make sure that you are in the `server` directory before running these terminal commands).

8. We will use Postman to test our app's functionality for handling POST requests.

9. We will rewrite the code for handling GET and POST requests such that it follows the convention for REST APIs.
